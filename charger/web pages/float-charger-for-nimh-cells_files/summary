It's a simple circuit, but does exactly what it's designed to do - dim LED lights or control the speed of 12V DC motors. The circuit uses PWM to regulate the effective or average current through the LED array, 12V incandescent lamp (such as a car headlight bulb) or DC motor. The only difference between the two modes of operation is the addition of a "},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://xtremecircuits.blogspot.com/feeds/2296075484849561942/comments/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http://xtremecircuits.blogspot.com/2011/03/pwm-dimmermotor-speed-controller.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2547328485090449002/posts/default/2296075484849561942"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2547328485090449002/posts/default/2296075484849561942"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://xtremecircuits.blogspot.com/2011/03/pwm-dimmermotor-speed-controller.html","title":"PWM Dimmer/Motor Speed Controller"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Admin"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-B4pMbAhzVok/TXZ-2pPF1lI/AAAAAAAAAsU/uZkNrNkqASg/s72-c/p126-pic%2528aecircuits.blogspot.com%2529.jpg","height":"72","width":"72"},"thr$total":{"$t":"0"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2547328485090449002.post-6421173870045011197"},"published":{"$t":"2011-03-08T10:52:00.000-08:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2011-03-08T11:19:23.522-08:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Motor Control"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Motor driver using TC4424"},"summary":{"type":"text","$t":"The circuit shown below is of a DC motor  driver circuit based on the IC TC4424 from Microchip.
